# Tales of Villagers: The Infiltrators

A Minecraft Mod based on Forge.

This idea comes from a card game called "The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow", and first proposed by El Trueno, one of the groupmate from the MCMod off-topic QQ group.

Adds some "fake villagers" (the Infiltrators) to the game, who will fake their works and prevent other villagers from working. Also, when raids occur, the Infiltrators will help the illagers to attack other villagers.
